ML Engineering focuses on designing, building, deploying, and maintaining scalable machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems by blending software engineering principles with data science and machine learning knowledge. ML engineers translate theoretical ML models into robust, production-ready applications, manage data pipelines, ensure model performance, and often serve as a crucial link between data scientists and operational systems. 
Key Responsibilities:
Model Deployment:
Implementing and deploying ML models developed by data scientists into scalable production environments, often by creating API endpoints. 
System Design:
Designing and building the infrastructure and pipelines needed to automate the entire ML workflow, from data ingestion to model training and deployment. 
Data Management:
Sourcing, cleaning, verifying, and managing large datasets to ensure they are high-quality for model training. 
Performance Optimization:
Optimizing ML algorithms and systems for speed, scalability, and accuracy. 
Monitoring & Maintenance:
Continuously monitoring the performance of deployed ML models and systems and retraining them as needed. 
Collaboration:
Working closely with data scientists, data engineers, and other stakeholders to integrate models into broader software applications. 
Skills & Knowledge:
Software Engineering:
Strong proficiency in programming languages (like Python), software development, system architecture, and deployment tools (such as Docker and Kubernetes). 
Machine Learning:
Understanding of ML concepts, algorithms, model development, and evaluation. 
Data Science & Statistics:
A foundational understanding of data analysis, statistics, and the ability to assess and organize large datasets. 
Cloud Platforms:
Familiarity with cloud technologies (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for building and deploying ML systems. 
ML Engineering vs. Data Science:
A Data Scientist focuses on researching, building, and validating theoretical models. 
An ML Engineer takes those theoretical models and builds, scales, and deploys them into functional, production-ready systems that deliver tangible business value.
